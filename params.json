{"name":"API Health Check","tagline":"Checking Your API's Health Since 1968","body":"## Welcome to the API HealthCheck Project\r\nThe API HealthCheck project aims to be a website and app that allows developers to easily check if APIs that they use or might use are online or offline. This service will provide the ability to see how often an API is up or down, how long it stays down, along with other data that may be pertinent. The service will also allow developers to put their APIs onto a global list that is viewable by everyone. This will allow developers who are searching for appropriate APIs to find reliable ones to use. It will also give the possibility for users to link to APIs on the global list to use in the promotion of their services.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
